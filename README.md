# TodoList
A web page that simulates a post it board

It uses Flask framework for backend (Which is still being developed)
Also bootstrap for webdesign

To start using it you must run it using flask.
On the content folder, run terminal and type: export FLASK_APP=application.py
Then type: flask run
This will allow you to access the website using the link that the terminal provides you.

The web usage is very user friendly, just add the text that you want to be in the postit cards.
To delete a card, just click on the 'x' on the top.
To delete all cards, just press the "Delete All" and confirm.
